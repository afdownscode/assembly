# assembly
basic masm programs

This contains assembly language programs I wrote for a class.
Briefly, it creates a menu with 3 math options and executes some basic math functions.
It will calculate primes, write out the fibonacci sequence, or print the squares up to a given number.
The code is for Windows MASM language.
You will need to use the Irvine libraries for the some macros.
I hope it might help someone who is stuck on a project.
Enjoy...
